## Automation of Plant Watering

### Problem Statement

During day-to-day activities many people often forget to water their plants and thus it becomes challenging for them to keep their plants healthy and alive. Also, it is a challenge for them to balance judicious water usage between both their household chores and watering of plants during periods of water shortage. Based on the above background, we thought that it is necessary to implement the automated system which will take care of plants considering the fundamental aspects of a home gardening system (i;e systems designed for household purposes.) Therefore, our project aims to implement a simple system, using multiple sensors for automatic watering of small potted plants with minimal human intervention.

### Conclusion

- The proposed system can be used to switch on/off the water pump according to the soil moisture levels there by automating the process of plant watering, which is one of the time consuming activities.

- The system uses information from the soil moisture sensor to water the plants which helps to prevent over-watering or under-watering of plants thereby avoiding both water wastage and any sort of damage to the plants.

- The system also monitors the water level in the storage tank through a water level sensor and relays the same the same to the user.

- The user can monitor the process online through an application. From this system it can be concluded that household watering of plants can be turned into a considerably easy process with the help of IoT.
